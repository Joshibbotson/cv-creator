#My first React project
Utilised:
- React (React hooks)
- Scss
- React-to-pdf library (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-to-pdf)

This was a particularly fun project to achieve. It taught me a lot about state management, React hooks and controlling rendering.

I also got to have some fun with SCSS to make a dynamic single page app.

Lastly I utilised React-to-pdf to give the user the capability of printing or saving their creation direct to pdf.
